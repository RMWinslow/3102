Extra credit idea:
An easy extra credit, worth 5 points. Just summarize an event to me.
A hard extra credit, worth 10 points, write an essay.

### citation test

Bolded title is non-standard but I think improves readbility.

Names (Date). **"Title."** *Publication including issue*
: Informal description of what the paper is about. This format is taken from my cartography textbook and I think it looks nice.
