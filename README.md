## Econ 3102 Notes

These are (some) of my notes for teaching Econ 3102. The dates on this page are specifically for Section 003 of Spring 2021.

If you are a fellow instructor, please contact me for additional resources which I can't host in a public repo.

If you are a student and have somehow found this page. Please navigate to the course canvas page at [canvas.umn.edu](canvas.umn.edu).


I have this site set up for notes because:
- These are more easily acessible on my phone.
- It is easier to update and navigate than a folder of LyX/LaTeX files
- Github automagically converts these notes from markdown to html using Jekyll, which means:
    - I can type these notes in easily readable plaintext
    - I can take the converted html source, which is more cleanly formatted than the html conversion from LyX or Pandoc, and copy it into the canvas page editors.
